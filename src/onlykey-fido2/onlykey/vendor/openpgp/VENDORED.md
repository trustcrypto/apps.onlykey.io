# Vendored openpgp.js (PQC-aware fork)

Unmodified copy, vendored directly into the source tree rather than pulled
in as an npm runtime dependency - same "push the official file into the
repo unmodified for verification, modify from there in git if needed"
principle already used for `../nacl.js`/`../forge.js`/
`../kbpgp-2.1.0.ok.ecc.js` and the `../@noble/` packages.

Needed for the composite PGP-PQC feature (ML-KEM-768 + ML-DSA-65 +
X25519 + Ed25519, maintainer TC-11): key generation, PGP message framing,
and the composite-KEM combine/AES-keywrap math for
`pqc_mlkem_x25519`/`pqc_mldsa_ed25519`.

## LOCAL MODIFICATION: conformance with draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc-10 (2026-08-06)

**This copy is no longer byte-identical to the fork as received.** The
fork implemented an **earlier revision** of the PQC draft in three
places, and all three are corrected here. The revision now targeted is
**draft-ietf-openpgp-pqc-10**, named rather than called "the IETF draft" —
saying which revision is the whole point, because the previous version of
this note said "IETF OpenPGP-PQC draft algos 105/107" and that sentence,
being wrong and confident, is why nobody re-checked for months.

### 1. Algorithm codepoints (`enums.publicKey`)

| algorithm | was | now |
|---|---|---|
| `pqc_mldsa_ed25519` | 107 | **30** |
| `pqc_mlkem_x25519`  | 105 | **35** |

IANA's OpenPGP Public Key Algorithms registry assigns 30 and 35, as does
the draft's own IANA section (§11). 105 and 107 sit in the range IANA
marks **"Private or Experimental Use"** (100–110), which means no other
implementation is expected to understand them.

*(One inconsistency in the draft itself, noted so the next reader does not
trip on it: §11's table gives the ML-DSA-65 signature as 3293 octets,
while Table 7 in §5.1.2 — the normative parameter table — gives 3309.
3309 is correct; it matches FIPS 204 and the signatures the device
actually produces.)*

### 2. ECC key share (`encaps$1` / `decaps$1`)

Draft §4.1.1.1, `x25519Kem.Encaps()`/`Decaps()`: "Set the output
ecdhKeyShare to X", the raw shared coordinate. The fork hashed it as
`SHA3-256(ss ‖ ct ‖ recipientPub)` first.

### 3. Key combiner (`multiKeyCombine`)

Draft §4.2.1, verbatim:

```
KEK = SHA3-256( mlkemKeyShare ‖ ecdhKeyShare ‖ ecdhCipherText ‖
                ecdhPublicKey ‖ algId ‖ domSep ‖ len(domSep) )
```

`domSep` is the UTF-8 encoding of `OpenPGPCompositeKDFv1`; `len(domSep)`
is a single octet, decimal 21.

The fork used `KMAC256` keyed on the two shares, over data that also
carried `mlkemCipherText` and `mlkemPublicKey`, with the domain separator
as the KMAC personalization. The ML-KEM ciphertext and public key are no
longer inputs at all.

### Why this had to happen before a release

None of it is a re-tagging. The algorithm ID is an input to the combiner,
and the combiner and key share determine the KEK — so keys and messages
made under the old scheme cannot be read under the new one, in either
direction. Correcting it after a release would orphan every key real
users had generated.

### What did NOT change

**Nothing on the device.** The firmware stores four raw seeds and returns
raw ML-KEM and X25519 shared secrets; it never sees an OpenPGP algorithm
ID, and every hash and combine happens host-side. `hooks.ecdh` fires
inside `recomputeSharedSecret()`, one level below the key-share layer, so
the device contract is untouched by construction. The on-device composite
operations were re-run against this tree and are unaffected.

Also unchanged: the composite **signature** path, which was already
conformant — only the codepoint was wrong there.

### Verified against an independent implementation

rpgp 0.20 (`draft-pqc`), Rust/RustCrypto, which shares no code with
OpenPGP.js. All four directions pass — it parses the key, decrypts what
we encrypt, we decrypt what it encrypts, and it verifies our composite
signatures. Before these changes it could not parse our keys at all.

Anyone revisiting this when the draft moves again should repeat that
check against a second implementation rather than against another copy of
this fork: generating with one copy and parsing with the other agrees
perfectly and proves nothing about the wire format, which is exactly how
the wrong codepoints survived.

Keep this file and `python-onlykey/onlykey/openpgp_bridge/openpgp.js` in
step — they are required to stay **byte-identical**, so re-check with
`md5sum` after editing either one.

## Provenance

This is **not** stock upstream OpenPGP.js - no release of real OpenPGP.js
supports the composite PQC algorithms yet. There is no "official pristine
upstream" to point at instead: this exact file (header: "OpenPGP.js v6.0.0
- 2026-07-06") is the project-specific fork already used by
`python-onlykey/onlykey/openpgp_bridge/bridge.js` (the Node bridge behind
the CLI's `onlykey-cli pgp` commands), so it's the right "official file"
to vendor per this project's principle.

Copied byte-for-byte, unmodified, from
`python-onlykey/onlykey/openpgp_bridge/openpgp.js` (confirmed via `diff`
at vendor time - identical).

## Why no webpack resolve.alias is needed

Unlike the `@noble/*` vendor packages, this is a single self-contained
UMD-style bundle (`var openpgp = (function (exports) {...})({})`) with
no external `require()`/`import` statements at all (confirmed via grep) -
it doesn't even depend on the `@noble/*` vendor tree, since the fork
implements its own PQC primitives internally. Load it like any other
same-directory vendored file (`nacl.js`/`forge.js`) - no build-config
changes required.

## Hardware-hook API (the reason this fork exists)

The fork adds a first-class, purpose-built hook API for routing
private-key operations to an external device instead of holding real key
material in the browser - confirmed via direct read, not assumed:

- `openpgp.setHardwareHooks({ signer, decryptor, ecdh, mlkemDecaps })` -
  registers one or more hooks (`openpgp.js:8747`). Each hook may return
  `null`/`undefined` to fall through to the software path.
- `openpgp.clearHardwareHooks()` - reverts to pure software (`:8753`).
- `openpgp.createHardwarePrivateKey(publicKey)` - builds a `PrivateKey`
  from a real `PublicKey` (correct fingerprint/key-id/algorithm) whose
  secret packets are marked "decrypted" with placeholder private params
  tagged `isHardwareBacked: true` (`:22197`). This is what lets normal
  `openpgp.decrypt()`/`sign()`/`verify()` calls transparently route through
  the hooks - no manual PGP-packet surgery needed on the app side.

`hooks.ecdh`/`hooks.mlkemDecaps` are gated on the `isHardwareBacked`
marker; `hooks.signer` fires unconditionally whenever registered. See
`composite_pgp.js` (sibling of this vendor dir's parent) for how this app
wires these hooks to the device transport.
